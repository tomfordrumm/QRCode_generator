# QR Code Generator

This project provides a simple QR code generator with extensive styling options based on [qr-code-styling](https://github.com/kozakdenys/qr-code-styling).

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. All required libraries are loaded via CDN, so no build step is needed.

The left panel contains the QR code settings, including colors, dimensions, dot styles, and the ability to add a logo image. The right panel displays a live preview and a button to download the generated code as PNG or SVG.

The interface is built with Tailwind CSS and works on both desktop and mobile screens.
